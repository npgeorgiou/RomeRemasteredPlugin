{governors_house_barbarian}	Warrior's Hold

{governors_house_barbarian_desc}
A Warrior's Hold is the place where lesser men gather to do a leader's bidding. Without his say-so nothing happens, making this the heart of the village.\n\nThis is where workers are called in time of war, and where orders are issued for new buildings in times of peace. By sword-right, the Warrior's Hold is the largest and most 'magnificent' construction amid the surrounding squalor.

{governors_house_barbarian_desc_short}

It is always better to attack an enemy from a distance, for then he cannot always strike back. A Catapult Range lets artillerists, archers and javelinmen fire away to their hearts content during training - and all without the risk of killing too many innocent bystanders! The engineers needed to build large artillery weapons are nearby, and can assist in the training of crews. Other missile troops can use the same range during their training.

{farms+4_carthage_desc}
Being trapped between the desert and the sea at Carthage taught Carthaginian farmers to get the most from their lands - if they did not, the city starved, even without the threat of famine. These farming techniques are now known to all within Carthage's domain.\n\nThe land itself is often owned by great families, but slaves are put to the back-breaking work of producing a huge surplus of food, which in turn fuels the further growth of cities and prosperity.

The farming skills learned in the Nile valley make Egyptian farmers second to none. They can improve any land in the world and make it highly productive. These farming techniques are widespread in Pharaoh's domains, thanks to his wisdom in appointing servants to run large estates. Slaves and peasants may do the back-breaking labour, but it is the Pharaoh and his trusted appointees who ensure that there are large food surpluses. These can be sent to the great cities of Pharaoh's realm to ensure growth and prosperity.

The need to grow even more food leads to increases in the size and efficiency of farms. Latifundia are enormous and efficient estates that are put together through legally confiscating land from peasant farmers. Worked by slaves, they produce huge surpluses and are very profitable to the owners. Everyone (except the dispossessed peasants and the slaves) does very well out of the Latifundia system.

This provincial arena allows small-scale Games to be staged for the entertainment and satisfaction of all true Romans. The Games are part of what makes Romans properly 'Roman', and everyone feels part of the community and forgets their problems on days when there are Games to go to! Everyone feels even happier knowing that the Games are free and that a wealthy man, keen to increase his popularity, is paying.\n\nThe Arena also bolsters Romans' happiness to know that they are a superior people: when even the condemned and slaves die with courage, can a true Roman do any less in the face of death?\n\nAn Arena can be upgraded as the settlement grows in size and importance.

This substantial amphitheatre allows Games that properly reflect the grandeur and glory of the Roman world. Weak-kneed foreigners may faint at the spectacle, but the Roman crowd know how to appreciate and enjoy the Games! The atmosphere and the ceremony help glue the Roman world together, and make everyone feel good to be a Roman citizen. That the games are free to attend is simply a bonus - so what if some spoiled rich boy in a toga wants to impress everyone? Let him! And let the Games commence!\n\nAn Amphitheatre can be upgraded as the city grows in size and importance.

This magnificent setting allows the staging of Games that satisfy the passions of all true Romans. Gladiators willingly face death, knowing that their courage will be celebrated by a knowledgeable and appreciative crowd! This is truly a magnificent public building for all Romans to enjoy as equals.\n\nThe Games staged here are truly spectacular! No expense will be spared in collecting savage and rare beasts from all over the world, nor in gathering the finest, most expensive and most famous gladiators to perform. To live in a city with an amphitheatre is to be happy, and entertained lavishly at someone else's expense! \n\nThere's always an excuse to put on some kind of show too: games to influence local elections or mark victories; funerary games to mark the death of a great man; or votive games to thank the Gods. With Roman practicality, though, the Gods don't get their thanks until whatever the problem they were supposed to solve really has gone away!

{temple_of_fun_large_temple_greek}	Large Temple of Dionysus

{temple_of_fun_large_temple_greek_desc}
This Large Temple is dedicated to Dionysus, the God of Wine, although his Cultists go far beyond merely drinking heavily in their celebration of his mysteries. Dionysus is a violent figure, and his followers tread a fine line between sanity, madness and death at times in their orgiastic rituals. \n\nReligion generally makes people feel happy and content knowing that the Gods are lavishly honoured. \n\nThis Temple can be improved as the settlement grows in size and importance.

{temple_of_fun_large_temple_roman}	Large Temple of Bacchus

{temple_of_fun_large_temple_roman_desc}
This Large Temple is dedicated to Bacchus, the God of Wine. He is a noisy and rowdy God at the best of times. At his worst, Bacchus is downright dangerous to those who aren't his followers! Drunken revelry may only be the start of a serious session of enjoying the wine that Bacchus provides! \n\nReligion always makes a people feel happy and content to know that the Gods are lavishly honoured. \n\nThis Temple can be improved as the settlement grows in size and importance.

{temple_of_naval_temple_roman}	Temple of Neptune

{temple_of_naval_temple_roman_desc}
This Temple is dedicated to Neptune, the God of the Sea. He is seen as the special protector of sailors and those who gain a living from the deeps. He is often depicted as an elderly man astride a dolphin, although storms - his sea rages - can be terrible enough for a much younger person! \n\nReligion always makes a people feel happy and content to know that the Gods are properly honoured. \n\nThis Temple can be improved as the settlement grows in size and importance.

They are among the finest buildings in any city.\n\nThe senior units trained here rightly consider themselves elite, aristocratic forces, even if all the 'pampering' (in comparison to the downtrodden infantry) does make them all a little headstrong in battle.\n\nThe stables are magnificent, and able to house and train war animals other than horses. The farriers and armourers attached to this building can also turn their hands to producing armour for almost any animals, even elephants!

The Circus is a prestige building, used to stage highly popular races. The skills needed to handle horses here are used to train elite cavalry units to defend the Empire.\n\nIt is, however, the Races that make this building popular, as these are fast, dramatic and dangerous. Individual teams attract fanatical followings, and race days can provoke powerful loyalties in the plebian mob. Deaths among the crowd are not unknown as rival supporters fight after particularly exciting or close-run events - not to mention those where there has been a lot of cheating!

{archery_range_barbarian_desc}
Archery is a skill that takes time and patience to perfect. The strength to use a bow is only acquired through long hours of practice. Most recruits know how to use a bow from hunting, but this is different from using a bow in battle. An Archery Range gives the space for bowmen to develop their skills and group tactics.\n\nSkilled craftsmen are also to be found here, capable of making larger weapons too.

Archers need space to practice constantly before, during and after being formed into warbands. Good archers require strength as well as co-ordination.

This Shrine is dedicated to Nike, the winged Goddess of Victory. That a warlike people such as the Greeks should honour her is almost inevitable!

This Temple City is dedicated to all the Gods, but primarily Osiris, the God and the Judge of the Dead, and the Lord of Resurrection. Murdered by Set, he was the first person to die and thus became the lord of death. 

{temple_of_fun_pantheon_greek}	Pantheion

{temple_of_fun_pantheon_greek_desc}
This Pantheion is for all the Gods, but was originally dedicated to Dionysus, the God of Wine, although his Cultists go far beyond merely drinking heavily in their celebration of his mysteries. Dionysus is a violent figure, and his followers tread a fine line between sanity, madness and death at times in their orgiastic rituals. \n\nReligion generally makes people feel happy and content knowing that the Gods are honoured in such a grand fashion.

{temple_of_fun_pantheon_roman_desc}
This Pantheon is for all the Gods, but was originally devoted to the worship of Bacchus, the God of Wine. He is a noisy and rowdy God at the best of times. At his worst, Bacchus is downright dangerous to those who aren't his followers! Drunken revelry may only be the start of a serious session of enjoying the wine that Bacchus provides! \n\nReligion always makes a people feel happy and content to know that all the Gods are honoured in such a magnificent setting.

{stables_barbarian_desc}
This is the basic building required for training cavalry units. Stables can be improved as the settlement grows so that a wider range of cavalry types - that require different types of horse - can be trained. \n\nHorses are far too valuable to be used for farming (oxen, donkeys and slaves are used instead), and are bred for war, not work. Just about every horse-using tribe is highly stratified, as horses are expensive to rear and keep and having one is a matter of status among an aristocracy.

{practice_field_barbarian_desc}
Learning to skirmish effectively requires an open space where lightly armed and armoured warriors can safely practise with missile weapons. There are also the tactics of movement and disengagement to be passed on, all of which need space - by contrast a swordsman can be taught wherever there is enough room to swing a blade!

{practice_field_barbarian_desc_short}
The arts of skirmishing and archery are not the same as fighting in a solid battle line. Space is needed to train warriors to do this effectively in groups.

{practice_field_carthage_desc}
Learning to skirmish effectively requires an open space where lightly armed and armoured troops can safely practice with missile weapons. There are also the tactics of movement and disengagement to be practiced, which also needs more space than a simple yard for close-order drills.

A Practice Range is the space needed to muster and train light troops. This is particularly true for javelin practice!\n\nThe most famous of these fields is probably the Campus Martia - the Field of Mars - in the eternal city of Rome itself.\n\nAfter the Marian reforms, the Auxilia form a professional wing of the army, rewarded by citizenship.

A rough wooden wall is a better defence than a palisade of stakes, but it is still not much of an obstacle to organised attackers.

These walls are easy to construct, even with an unskilled workforce. Improving the walls also adds grain stores to extend the time a settlement can resist a siege.

A rough wooden wall is a better defence than a crude palisade, but it is not likely to present much of a problem to attackers.

{wooden_wall_greek_desc}
A rough wooden wall is a better defence than a palisade of stakes, but it is still not much of a problem to organised attackers. It will delay attackers getting into the settlement, and so is a good barrier against surprise raids. More organised attackers will, however, break the wall down sooner rather than later.\n\nThe wall also keeps locals and their livestock safe at night and gives a sense of permanence to a town.

By changing field usage every year and allowing land to lie fallow or be used as pasture, the goodness of the land is slowly restored. Crop yields and surpluses improve as a result, and the increased output adds to population growth. Slave labour also helps, as peasant farmers generally keep more produce for themselves.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

A Theatre is cleverly constructed so that every member of the audience can hear and enjoy the play. The building is actually a perfect example of superior Greek skill in mathematics and architecture in itself: a whisper from an actor carries to every part of the audience.\n\nAll that would be entirely pointless but for the wit and drama that Greek playwrights display in their works. Who - other than a blathering barbarian - would not be entertained and made happy in such a place?
