{barb_peasant_briton}	Barbarian Peasants

{barb_peasant_briton_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Forests\n\nPeasants are reluctant warriors, but barbarian peasants are better fighters than most: hard lives produce hard men. Numbers are useful in all armies, and forcing peasants to fight is one way of getting lots of men in the field quickly and cheaply. They have little tactical sense, and even less willingness to fight - they would rather be defending their own homes than be dragged to a battle they neither care about nor understand. They are, however, experts at reading the land and hiding when there is cover.

{barb_peltast_gaul}	Skirmisher Warband

{barb_peltast_gaul_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Forests\nCan Hide in Long Grass\n\nSkirmishers are lightly armed troops who should break up and harass enemy formations before the main battle lines meet, and act as a screen for heavier troops. Their skills also make them useful in springing tactical ambushes.\n\nEach man is armed with a clutch of throwing spears, a short sword and a small shield, but they do not wear armour preferring speed over protection. \n\nSkirmisher Warbands are often the tribe's younger warriors. These men have yet to prove themselves as warriors, so are not necessarily tough enough to stand against a seasoned enemy in hand-to-hand fighting.

{barb_peltast_gaul_descr_short}
Skirmishers rush forward to pepper an enemy with throwing spears, and then run away before a counter-attack can be organised.

{barb_slinger_briton}	Slingers

{barb_slinger_briton_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Forests\n\nA sling is a deceptively simple weapon: a slinger can bring down the strongest man with a single shot. These slingers can send a hail of bullets towards the enemy, and target their shots for maximum damage. After all, they will have been hunting with slings since boyhood. Slingers should not be allowed to get into melee combat, as their lack of armour and their relative lack of equipment - just a knife or short sword and a shield - will soon lead to them being cut to pieces. Used to kill enemies from a distance, they are superb missile warriors.

{barb_archer_dacian}	Archer Warband

{barb_archer_dacian_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Woods\n\nArcher warbands are used to harass and break up enemy formations, so that other warriors can then get in amongst their enemies. The members of the warband are lightly armed and equipped, relying more on speed as a protection from foes. Any archers caught in the open by cavalry will be in trouble unless they can withdraw to more favourable ground or behind a shield wall of friendly warriors.\n\nTheir bows have a short range, but each warrior carries a good selection of hunting and war arrows, designed to cause massive bleeding and pierce armour respectively. Their choice of missile is matched to the nature of the target.\n\nThese archers are at their best in wooded country, where their superior stalking skills learned on the hunt can be put to use.

Superior\nHardy\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nChosen archers are highly prized for their superior skills in war. They are the best archers available to barbarian warlords. They are all, as might be expected, excellent bowmen, fleet of foot and expert hunters. They are given the best bows available to their people, and are also equipped with good swords and chainmail armour too. This equipment means that they can do more than just defend themselves in hand-to-hand combat. They can, when required, act as light infantry. Their presence on a battlefield is always useful, as they have the flexibility to be both archers and infantry and do a good job in both tasks.

{warband_huntsman_gaul}	Forester Warband

{warband_huntsman_gaul_descr}
Elite\nCan Hide Anywhere\nVery Hardy\n\nA life spent hunting is an excellent training for war. Personal courage, skill and the readiness to take a life can all be learned during a hunt. Foresters are highly skilled men with both the bow and the spear, their preferred weapons. They also each wear good leather armour.\n\nTheir hunting skills also stand them in good stead when stalking men instead of animals - these men can hide almost anywhere, taking advantage of every scrap of cover. The ability to spring ambushes as well as fight hand-to-hand makes them a uniquely flexible force for a warlord and one that, unusually, has enough sense to obey all orders. Foresters already know that they are superb hunters and warriors, and do not need to prove their skills to anyone by attacking just because they can!

{warband_hurler_briton_descr}
Wild\nImpetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nIn battle, head hurlers throw the heads of fallen foes coated with quicklime. These missiles are both dangerous and loathsome. Head hurlers combine the practical and the macabre in equal measure - they collect the heads of fallen enemies and preserve these by dipping them in quicklime. The limed heads are used as disgusting missiles in battle, flung into enemy ranks at surprisingly long range. As missiles the heads are heavy enough to cause injuries (and have an undoubted impact on morale) but it is the lime that really does the damage, causing nasty burns. Head Hurlers also carry swords for use in close combat should this be necessary.\n\nHead hurlers, however, also show little regard for their own danger and are not above rushing into combat without orders.

Their spears, however, make them valuable defensive warriors for any warlord.\n\nThe warband is the basic unit of any barbarian army - a group of tough warriors bound together in the service of a tribal strongman or village headman. Each warrior is protected by a large shield. In common with other Germanic warriors, these men are very clever when concealing themselves in forests.

Superior\nImpetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Woods\n\nFalxmen are used to carve a path into enemy formations. They are superior, but somewhat ill-disciplined warriors who are willing to charge into a fight without orders. They wear no armour, partly as a sign of their bravery and partly because it would interfere with the free swinging of their falxes.\n\nA falx can cut a man in two lengthways in the hands of a skilled user. It is a frightening weapon: a curved scythe-like blade on the end of a long handle that is sharpened on the inner curve of the blade. The damage from any blow is done with a pulling motion, meaning that any blow that lands will hack off a limb or decapitate a foe at the least. Historically, this is one of the few weapons that made the Romans change their standardised armour, as they added reinforcing bars to Legionary helmets after encountering falxmen.

Impetuous\nHardy\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nReligion and magic are powerful reasons for bravery.\n\nWoad warriors are brave fighters - and mad. They disdain armour and most clothing, preferring to paint themselves with intricate and stylised magical designs in woad (a blue dye) to deflect enemy blows and missiles. The patterns created can be elaborate and almost inhuman, and are supposed to be unnerving for enemies unused to such practices. Belief in magic also armours the woad warriors against fear, and makes them savage, dangerous and not-quite-controllable fighters. Woad warriors carry only blades and shields but it is a foolish commander indeed who underestimates their impact in battle!

They are best sent into battle en masse, shocking the enemy by a ferocious charge, but they should be kept away from enemy cavalry.\n\nThey carry just swords and shields and have practically no discipline, but they can cause heavy casualties among most enemies. They fight mostly (if not completely) naked to emphasise their own fierceness and utter lack of fear. Scars and tattoos adorn their skin, and they let their hair grow wild. Only after a kill is their hair cut, often with a sword blade while standing over a freshly dead foe.\n\nWhile their reckless courage is not in doubt, they can lack the cohesion and discipline to adapt to setbacks, breaking and running in confusion when subjected to severe pressure.

Impetuous\nHardy\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nThere are warriors among the barbarian ranks whose love of battle is such that they live for little else. Clad only in flimsy loincloths, the fanatics whip themselves into a frenzy by chanting, beating themselves and drinking heavily. In this state they make an unnerving sight on the battlefield! They are best sent into battle en masse, shocking the enemy by a ferocious charge, but they should be kept away from enemy cavalry.\n\nThey carry just swords and shields and have practically no discipline, but they can cause heavy casualties among most enemies. They fight mostly (if not completely) naked to emphasise their own fierceness and utter lack of fear. Scars and tattoos adorn their skin, and they let their hair grow wild. Only after a kill is their hair cut often with a sword blade while standing over a freshly dead foe.\n\nWhile their reckless courage is not in doubt, they can lack the cohesion and discipline to adapt to setbacks, breaking and running in confusion when subjected to severe pressure.

Wild and savage, naked fanatics are always a threat but are at a disadvantage when fighting cavalry.

{night_raiders_german_descr}
Hardy\nFrightens Infantry\n\nFor most armies, night is a time for withdrawing to camp and roasting a boar or two. For German night raiders, it’s the time to paint themselves and set out in search of enemies to slaughter.\n\nLightly armed infantry, the night raiders' value lies in their ability to spread terror. These warriors from the remote depths of the tangled German forests carry just a small shield and an axe, but weapons of iron and steel are only part of their armoury. Before battle, they daub their bodies with black dye, giving them an otherworldly appearance. When the moment is right, they charge - wild-eyed and screaming - at their foes. Any who survive assaults by these maniacal barbarians are convinced they are spirits sent from Hades!

They will use chants, strong drink, potions, rituals and even self mutilation to whip themselves into a fighting frenzy. Once the madness is upon them, little can stop them - their blood-crazed dash into the thick of combat is deeply disheartening (at best) to any who stand against them. They may try to cut their enemies to pieces in this state, but will think nothing of trying to gouge, bite, head butt and kick opponents to death as well.\n\nThey disdain armour as a sign of weakness, along with mercy, common sense and knowing when to stop fighting. They are supremely dangerous foes in close combat.

It’s not uncommon for women to accompany armies on campaign, but few actually take to the battlefield. Germanic warriors are inordinately proud, so the prospect of facing the scorn of their women is more than many care to think about. While they wield their hatchets with gusto, their true value is in the unnerving effects they have on enemies - the foul ululations of these women can strike fear into the strongest of hearts! They are best positioned safely behind friendly infantry where, like dark and demented cheerleaders, they can avoid combat while creating their particular brand of intimidation.

They are, however, prone to attacking whether or not it makes sense to their warlord - glory and honour are always worth pursuing, after all!\n\nThey are best employed at what they do best - hitting an enemy hard and repeatedly.

Most nobles and their retinues from these territories are highly practiced in this deadly art from an early age. Scythian nobles are disciplined, following the well-established code of honour of the upper circles of their people. \n\nThese units of aristocratic mounted bowmen are composed of men of well above average station. They can afford a better class of equipment than typical horse archers, including coats of mail that hang to the rider’s knees when he is in the saddle. They also carry swords, and are not afraid to close for a melee if the opportunity presents itself but are sensible enough not to hurl themselves into the fray without orders.

Head hunting maidens are a product of this ethos, and have a strong motive for drawing blood in battle: they are forbidden from marrying until they do so. In the same fashion as any other Scythian warrior, high-ranking maidens who fall in battle are given honour burials along with their weapons and equipment.\n\nFor all their valour, these virgin warriors are physically weaker than most of their male opponents. Consequently, they make good light cavalry, riding down and disrupting enemy archers and light infantry, but (for the sake of future generations if nothing else) they should be protected from the enemy’s stronger forces.

Superior\nCan Form Cantabrian Circle\n\nScythian noble women are excellent and well-armoured horse archers, but they are vulnerable in close combat. Among the horse tribes of Scythia, it is expected that women of noble families will ride into battle alongside the men. These women provide valuable support to their male kin, softening up the enemy prior to the main battle with a deadly hail of missiles. They are excellent archers and riders, even by the standards of Scythian horsemen. They are armed with superbly accurate and powerful composite bows, but only carry knives for defence.\n\nThe martial culture of Scythia is not discriminatory when it comes to battle: Scythian women who fall in combat are usually buried with their war gear in the same way as the men. Some young girls even have their right breasts mutilated with a hot iron so they don’t restrict their right arms or a bow string. Perhaps such practices are the origin of the stories about the tribe of fearsome Amazon warrior women, said to rule a city hidden somewhere on the steppes!

Their war gear is literally no more than a cheap shield and a spear, so they are defensive troops best used against light cavalry. They should not be expected to stand unsupported against an enemy, and until they have been seasoned by surviving a battle or two they shouldn't be expected to do much more than defend themselves! They are, however, cost effective to raise.

{carthaginian_medium_infantry}	Libyan Spearmen

{carthaginian_medium_infantry_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nLibyan spearmen are best when defending against cavalry, but can hold a battle line for a while when required. They are recruited from among the lower orders of Carthaginian society, and given basic training in how to handle their spears and war gear. They are better equipped than, say, militia, as they have light leather armour as well as shields and helmets. Their training also makes them effective in battle, as they are unlikely to cut and run in the same way as a militia unit.

They are equipped and organised in the same fashion as Greek hoplites, with long spears, large shields, breastplates and helmets, and they can use phalanx tactics. This is a style of warmaking that has proved its worth over the centuries.\n\nThey are drawn from the social elite of Carthage, men of noble and wealthy birth and their loyalty is exemplary. The original purpose of the Sacred Band was to act as an officer corps for the Carthaginian army and an elite force, and to put Carthage above any local loyalties. Opponents have learned that these men are formidable in battle, a linchpin for the entire Carthaginian army!

These elite fighters are shock troops who disregard all danger when cutting their enemies to pieces. Carrying only a sword and shield they do not look much of a threat, a mistaken assessment that enemies rarely get to make twice! This is particularly true of they manage to ambush enemy forces. They fear no men and their over-eagerness to join a battle can be problematic, but like all foot soldiers, they need to be wary of cavalry.\n\nBull warriors derive their name from the distinctive horned helmets which they wear.

They are recruited from amongst nomadic peoples who need their weapon skills to survive in harsh conditions.\n\nThey are best employed to harry enemies and thin their ranks with volleys of missiles. They should avoid being sucked into hand-to-hand combat, as their knives are more useful in skinning animals than killing men; also, other than a small shield they have no armour.\n\nHistorically, Numidian justice was extremely harsh on deserters and cowards: crucifixion was a common punishment.

The prospect of a punishing march across great distances to these robust people is almost as familiar to them as the passing of each day. Equipped with spears and large shields of wood and animal hide, battle holds few fears for these people - life in a desert gives people a certain fatalism.\n\nThey are some of the best fighters available to Numidian commanders, but their lack of formal training is a slight weakness.

They have had training from Roman advisors, and this makes them the best trained of all Numidian soldiery. They cannot, however, use tactics like the tortoise (or testudo) when approaching enemy formations, but they do fight in the same fashion as the original Legionaries, first throwing heavy spears (pila) at the enemy and then closing for hand-to-hand combat.\n\nA combination of rugged upbringing and harsh training makes them reliable and slow to tire in combat: a Numidian force can be sure that these men will do their duty.

This makes them a flexible and powerful force for any commander to have under his hand. They can also fight effectively in melee after a charge, as they carry swords of the falcata design. These are cunningly balanced so that the weight is towards the tip of the sword, giving a powerful cutting blow. Against spearmen, however, they can be at a disadvantage.

They carry spears and wear good armour, so that they can charge home with devastating effect. They are the devoted servants of Astarte, handed over to the temple and state by their patrician families for military duties rather than ritual sacrifice.\n\nHistorically, the great Carthaginian general Hannibal took units of the Sacred Band over the Alps and into Italy; even though they got no reinforcements from home two-thirds of these men were still fighting after 14 years of campaigning.

{numidian_cavalry_descr}
Hardy\nCan Form Cantabrian Circle\n\nNumidia produces some of the finest cavalry in all Africa, if not the Western Mediterranean world. Armed with javelins, these mounted skirmishers can be a nightmare for an opponent as it can prove practically impossible to pin them down in combat.\n\nTheir tactics are to pelt the enemy with deadly volleys of javelins, and then swiftly retreat when charged. If the enemy stand, they are slaughtered with volleys of javelins, and if they run the Numidian cavalry can ride them down!\n\nInstinctive riders, the Numidians are famed for not using a saddle or reins, using only a stick to direct their horses. Nevertheless, they manoeuvre with the 'grace of a flock of birds'.\n\nHaving adapted to the broken expanses of their homelands, Numidian cavalry have great stamina, and they are also experts in their form of the Cantabrian circle attack.

Warhounds are bred for a savage nature and great size, but then hunting men is only a little more dangerous than hunting mountain lions! The beasts are muscular and powerful. Originally bred for hunting large prey, they are now trained to hunt and attack men. Warhounds are usually unleashed on an enemy to break a line and unnerve opponents. Few men are able to stand steadily in the face of a snarling and partially-starved beast. The hounds are trained to bite and hold on, dragging down their human targets, and hamstringing horses.\n\nTheir handlers are brave and not easily intimidated: many have fingers, hands or even chunks of limbs missing!

When this happens no one - friend or foe - is safe. For this reason the driver always carries a small mallet and a spike so that he can kill the animal if necessary by driving the spike into the base of the skull.\n\nThe crew are armed with bows to shoot down into tightly packed enemy formations, but the elephant itself is also a weapon: it can trample and gore men easily, hurling them around like rag dolls.

{carthaginian_onagers_descr}
Fires Incendiary Missiles\n\nThe onager is a catapult jokingly named for the tremendous kick it has when fired at the enemy (an "onager" is a wild ass). This war machine is powered by a twisted spring of animal sinew ropes, the most elastic substance available. \n\nThe throwing arm is held in tension by the sinews. When pulled back and held by a catch it can fling a boulder with considerable speed and range. This version can be used for reducing stone fortifications, but it can also be used on the battlefield for destroying enemy artillery and harassing troops (although admittedly by killing some of them outright).\n\nThe onager can also be used to launch incendiary missiles such as firepots, making it a versatile piece of artillery to any commander.

{east_peasant_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nPeasants are reluctant warriors, but numbers are useful in all armies. Forcing peasants to fight is one way of getting lots of men in the field quickly and cheaply. They have little tactical sense, and even less willingness to fight - they would rather be defending their own homes than be dragged to a battle they neither care about nor understand. But if nothing else, they are useful when there's digging to be done! They are, however, experts at reading the land and hiding whenever there is cover.

They are skirmishers and not intended to hold a position in a battle line. Instead, their job is to harass and disrupt enemy units as well as screen the main force of the army. They are also adept - as their abilities would suggest - at staging tactical ambushes.\n\nPeltasts are equipped with a clutch of javelins, a sword and a light shield, the pelte, which gives them their name as 'pelte-bearers'. They wear no other armour, and rely on speed as the best form of protection.

Sapping Ability\n\nSlingers are highly skilled missile troops but are at a huge disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat, especially against cavalry. They can maintain a sustained and concentrated barrage on enemies and then fall back rapidly to avoid hand-to-hand combat. Slingers carry a shoulder bag with many pieces of lead shot (they can also use stones picked up on the battlefield) and several spare slings including slings of different length for greater or lesser range. Other than a knife and a small shield, they carry no other equipment.

Although only armed with spears and shields, they are a valuable addition to many forces. Their skills at reading ground allow them to hide where others cannot, and this makes them valuable to commanders with a penchant for tactical ambushes.\n\nThey are expert raiders and thieves (often taking sheep and goats from their lowland neighbours) and this is, unfortunately, something that makes them occasionally difficult to control.

They are drawn from among the peasantry and urban poor, given minimal training and sent into battle. They are, however, given large shields.\n\nIndividually, they are not outstanding warriors, but as a group they have their uses in holding off light cavalry; even medium and heavier troops will be unwilling to charge into a forest of spear points.

Their war gear includes long spears, chainmail and round shields.They can withstand attacks by most cavalry, and the training they have received allows them to form phalanx and carry an attack to an enemy infantry line. Against skirmishers and other missile troops, however, they require some support.\n\nThese men are recruited from the native population, not from among the Greek stratum of society that exists in all the Successor states, so they do not have the discipline of the 'hoplite ethos' in their training. They are still, however, worthwhile troops.

{east_hoplite}	Phalanx Pikemen

{east_hoplite_descr}
Can Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nPhalanx pikemen, or phalangites, are well-drilled infantry who fight best as solid mass of men. They are armed with an enormously long pike, or sarissa, often 4-5m in length. This is the weapon that Alexander's armies used, and it has remained popular in all the Successor states that sprang up in his collapsed empire, even though most of the men recruited to fight as pikemen are neither Macedonian nor Greek by descent. It is popular because the first five ranks can present their pikes to the enemy creating a mobile forest of sharpened metal, while those further back hold them at a 45 degree angle to deflect enemy arrows.\n\nIn phalanx formation these men can advance in a disciplined mass and 'push' against an enemy line, often breaking through in the process as few enemies will stand in the face of so many spear points coming towards them! Indeed, from the front a phalanx can be almost invulnerable.

They are lightly armoured and carry a small shield, and each carries an enormously long pike, or sarissa. This 4-5m long spear allows up to five ranks of Bronze Shields to bring their weapons to bear on the enemy, while those further back can protect the front ranks by angling their pikes to deflect missile fire. When deployed as a phalanx they are extremely formidable unless outflanked, attacked from the rear or subjected to intense missile fire. Their superior discipline, training and espirit de corps makes them slow to tire on the battlefield as well.\n\nBronze shields are the successors to the hoplite warrior traditions of Greece and Macedonia; to carry a bronze shield means that you are worthy of honour and that your family has social standing.

Although armed and equipped in the manner of Roman legionaries, with iron-shafted throwing spears (pila), short swords, chainmail and large shields, these men are not of quite the same quality as the originals. Armenians are hardy folk and do not tire easily. It is true, and they have accepted the iron discipline that legionary training requires, but the quality of that training is not quite up to Roman standards. They are good heavy infantry once seasoned, but poor training means they cannot use the famous tortoise (testudo) formation. That said, they can still give a nasty shock to any enemy - their fighting style of bombarding an enemy with pila and then closing for the kill is just as effective when performed by Armenians as it is when Romans do the job!

They do not wear armour, but do carry shields and swords so that they can fight in hand-to-hand combat should the need arise. They are, however, best used to dash in and harass a mass of enemies such as heavy infantry who cannot hope to catch them. They are not ideally suited to fighting other skirmishers - many of their javelins will be wasted against targets who can dodge, after all - but they can be very useful in harrying fleeing enemies and driving them from the field.

They are the ultimate in shock cavalry, an armoured battering ram to crash into an enemy position and sweep aside all who stand against them. They are armed with heavy lances for the initial charge and maces for use in close combat. They wear armour that is almost unmatched for weight and protection, and their horses are similarly armoured. On the move they are a wall of metal bearing down on enemies, tipped with razor-sharp spear points.\n\nTheir armour is their main strength, but it also means that these troops can be quite ponderous and slow moving. That said, sheer weight means that they can often break through (or ride over) an enemy line without too much trouble.

They are not as headstrong as other elite heavy cavalry and will not charge without orders - war is a serious business that has little room for vainglorious folly. They wear heavy chainmail and carry swords for use in close combat once the initial charge is over and momentum has been lost. While not in quite the same class as the super-heavy cataphracts from nearby Armenia, these men are a powerful force. They should not, however, be expected to charge into prepared spearmen.\n\nCappadocia is a region that is famed for its cavalry, and these men are rightly feared throughout Asia Minor.

They can trace their lineage back to the tribes of the steppes, and this tradition gives them fine skills with both the horse and the compound bow. They wear mail armour and carry swords so that they can defend themselves at need, or even carry the attack to lighter opponents, but they are primarily fine horse archers, able to ruin formations of solidly-packed enemies.\n\nA skilled commander will use these troops in cooperation with heavier cataphracts when he can, softening up an opponent with missiles before delivering an armoured punch, or beating an enemy down before driving them from the field with lighter pursuers.

Superior\n\nCataphract archers are very heavily armoured, but slow, horse-archers that are almost impervious to attacks and can fight in close combat. They are not as armoured as cataphract lancers, yet most enemy missiles are turned aside quite easily. Mobility and speed have been sacrificed to provide protection. Their composite bows allow them to attack enemies at long range, but they also carry swords so that - if needs be - they can close up and fight hand-to-hand.\n\nThe weight of cataphract archers means that they are 'heavier' than most shock cavalry but this is not their primary purpose. Being able to fight in close combat should be seen as a bonus to their primary abilities.

{east_horse_archer}	Horse Archers

{east_horse_archer_descr}
Can Form Cantabrian Circle\n\nHorse archers are a speciality of the East: swift horses and expert marksmen make a deadly combination. They are armed with a powerful bow and a dagger for defence, but they are not armoured and should not be expected to fight other than to escape. Horse archers rely on the maxim that 'speed is armour' to keep them out of trouble. Infantry have no hope of catching them, but other cavalry may be able to chase them down. Wise eastern commanders know this, and deploy horse archers with other cavalry to act as a deterrent to over-ambitious pursuit by an enemy.\n\nIf horse archers have a weakness it is that of all soldiers armed with composite bows: these weapons do not take well to damp or wet weather, as the glues used to construct them become weakened. While this is seldom a problem in their home provinces, it can be in wetter climes.

Their primary purpose is to charge into the enemy, using weight and speed to cause additional disruption. The riders carry lances for the initial charge and long maces to continue fighting once in hand-to-hand combat. Recruited from among desert dwelling peoples these soldiers rely on their heavy armour for protection, and their camels are equally well protected. This heavy armour also means that, while they are slow to get moving, they are almost unstoppable in a full charge.\n\nThey can be used against infantry like any other cataphracts, but their chief virtue is that the smell of the camels upsets horses, giving them an edge when fighting against cavalry.

Elite\nImpetuous\nCan Run Amok\nFrightens Infantry\n\nScythed chariots are fearsome devices, covered in scythe blades to cut down any infantry foolish enough to stand when charged. Metal blades stick out from every axle like malign horns to cut down infantry. They are, however, somewhat uncontrollable: these units are not only so keen to attack the enemy that they will do so without orders, but also can run amok and attack anyone - friend or foe alike - who happens to be nearby. These are not subtle troops, and their chief power lies in a headlong charge into an enemy formation.\n\nEach chariot is pulled by powerful horses, and the driver is heavily armoured.

{east_onager}	Onagers

{east_onager_descr}
Fires Incendiary Missiles\n\nThe onager is a catapult jokingly named for the tremendous kick it has when fired at the enemy (an "onager" is a wild ass). This war machine is powered by a twisted spring of animal sinew ropes, the most elastic substance available. \n\nThe throwing arm is held in tension by the sinews. When pulled back and held by a catch it can fling a boulder with considerable speed and range. This version can be used for reducing stone fortifications, but it can also be used on the battlefield for destroying enemy artillery and harassing troops (although admittedly by killing them outright). \n\nThe onager can also be used to launch incendiary missiles such as firepots, making it a versatile piece of artillery to any commander.

Sapping Ability\n\nPeasants are reluctant warriors, but numbers are useful in all armies. Forcing peasants to fight is one way of getting lots of men in the field quickly and cheaply. They have little tactical sense, and even less willingness to fight - they would rather be defending their own homes than be dragged to a battle they neither care about nor understand. If nothing else, they are useful when there's digging to be done! They are, however, experts at reading the land and hiding whenever there is cover.

Sapping Ability\n\nSlingers are highly skilled missile troops but are at a huge disadvantage in hand-to-hand combat, especially against cavalry. They can maintain a sustained and concentrated barrage on enemies and then fall back rapidly to avoid hand-to-hand combat. Slingers carry a shoulder bag with many pieces of lead shot (they can also use stones picked up on the battlefield) and several spare slings including slings of different length for greater or lesser range. Other than a knife and a small shield, they carry no other equipment.

They carry the finest bows available, and have the abilities - honed from an early age - to make the best use of their weaponry, making them a true elite. And with their native toughness and hardy spirit they are truly impressive warriors, and a fine force for any of the Pharaoh’s generals to have under his command. Unlike many other archers, these men wear good armour, giving them protection against counter-fire, but they are vulnerable - like any archers - if unsupported when attacked by cavalry.

However, they can also be formed into phalanxes and sent against other infantry. Their lack of training and armour means that they should not be used to attack armoured or elite troops.\n\nNubian spearmen were originally recruited in the south, but since it is not uncommon for a Nubian soldier to be rewarded with land for his service, they can be found in every part of the Pharaoh's realms.

They are recruited into the service of the Pharaoh from the upper reaches of the Nile. They are superb horsemen, proud and independently minded. Nubians do not wear armour, but then this is only to be expected among people from such a hot, harsh climate, but they carry good war gear otherwise: a shield, a spear for the initial charge, and a sword so that they can fight effectively in close combat.\n\nThey can be used to mount rapid charges against enemies, but if asked to charge spearmen they will suffer excessive casualties. They can also be used to pursue fleeing foes and cut down isolated enemy units.

They are skirmishers and it is their task to harass and disrupt enemy units before the main battle lines clash. They are also adept at staging tactical ambushes.\n\nPeltasts are equipped with a clutch of javelins, a sword and a light shield, the pelte, which gives them their name as 'pelte-bearers'. They wear no other armour, and rely on speed as the best form of protection, and this isn't much protection should they be caught by cavalry.

{greek_heavy_peltast}	Heavy Peltasts

{greek_heavy_peltast_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Forests\nCan Hide in Long Grass\nSapping Ability\n\nHeavy peltasts are skirmishers, but carry large oval shields into battle. This added protection makes them suitable for standing in the main battle line, as well as for flanking and screening duties.\n\nTheir javelins are intended to thin the ranks of approaching troops, weakening their morale just before battle is joined. They also carry short swords for when they are asked to engage in close combat.\n\nA heavy peltast’s shield (the thureos), is made from wood covered in leather. While this confers reasonable protection, when confronted with heavy infantry or practically any form of cavalry, these troops should not be expected to stand for long. Like other peltasts, this unit is well suited to using ambush tactics.

{greek_heavy_peltast_descr_short}
A combination of protection and mobility make heavy peltasts suitable for skirmishing duties as well as for taking a stand as part of the main battle line.

{greek_hoplite}	Hoplites

{greek_hoplite_descr}
Hardy\nSapping Ability\nCan Form Phalanx\n\nThe basis of nearly all military power in Greece once revolved around the hoplite. Operating in phalanxes, or tightly grouped blocks, these men are a powerful force against infantry or cavalry.\n\nHoplite tactics are simple: formations generally approach the opposing army in normal order, and then close ranks into the phalanx so that each soldier is protected by overlapping shields. Then it is simply a matter of closing with the enemy as quickly as possible to decide the battle. Well trained, these troops have great stamina, and are some of the most effective soldiers in the known world.\n\nHoplites generally supply their own equipment, so are not drawn from the poorer sections of society. They wear a hardened leather cuirass breastplate, and carry both a round shield (the hoplon) and a thrusting spear. This spear has a bronze butt-spike to plant in the ground (bronze is not prone to rusting like iron), which doubles as a weapon if the pike shaft breaks.

{greek_hoplite_descr_short}
Hoplites are well equipped infantry that are most effective in the formidable, if slightly inflexible, phalanx formation.

Each of them is equipped with good body armour, greaves and a helmet and carries a large round shield, the hoplon that gives this kind of soldier the name of hoplite. Each man is also armed with a formidable thrusting spear called the xyston and a sword. They are usually employed as solid, close-packed groups of men, presenting a wall of spear points to the enemy. In phalanx formation, they use weight of numbers to batter into enemy formations.\n\nThey are vulnerable to flank and rear attacks, and ideally need some sort of light supporting troops to screen them as they approach the enemy.

Beyond Elite!\nDisciplined\nVery Hardy\nCan Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nSpartan hoplites are trained from infancy to be nothing but soldiers. They are 'perfect soldiers' and nothing else. All of Spartan life is spent training for war. Weaklings perish soon after birth; youths are taught to thieve and terrorize the slave class to harden them; young men are taught nothing unless it has something to do with the arts of war - even music and dance are there only to help keep step when marching and obeying orders.\n\nThe result is a man who thinks nothing of danger, expects to win, and creates a sense of dread in his opponents.\n\nSpartans fight in the traditional fashion as hoplites, carrying a long thrusting spear and the large round hoplon shield, and as a phalanx: a close-packed mass of men moving as one to crush their enemies.\n\nIf they have a weakness it is that they are hide-bound traditionalists, and the once-mighty state of Sparta has not moved with the times.

{greek_levy_pikemen}	Levy Pikemen

{greek_levy_pikemen_descr}
Can Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nAs war approaches, peasants, farmers and down-at-heel townsfolk can find themselves pressed into service as pikemen by their rulers. Due to their lack of armour they are best used as defensive infantry, absorbing enemy attacks, or screening the flanks of the main line.\n\nEquipped with a long pike some 6m in length (the sarissa) many ranks can bring their weapons to bear on an enemy, presenting a bristling array of spearheads to an approaching foe. They also carry swords for use when the enemy breaks through the pike line.\n\nAlthough training is practically non-existent, as inheritors of the hoplite tradition levy pikemen can manoeuvre in a phalanx formation. But with no armour other than the small shields strapped to their left arms, under pressure these levied troops are liable to suffer heavy casualties.

{greek_pikemen}	Phalanx Pikemen

{greek_pikemen_descr}
Can Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nPhalanx pikemen (or phalangites) form the backbone of Macedonian and Seleucid battle lines. In phalanx formation these troops can be used to pin the enemy line in place, while mobile forces wheel around the flanks to deliver a decisive blow. \n\nThe phalangites are drawn from families with decent resources, as these men need to provide leather cuirass armour and a metal helmet for protection. Phalanx pikemen carry a small shield strapped to the left arm, leaving both hands free to brandish a lengthy pike (the sarissa). Gripped in both hands above the head up to five ranks’ worth of pikes can be aimed at the enemy. Men in rows further back hold their pikes at a 45 degree angle, creating a shield to ward off enemy arrows. All phalanx pikemen also have short swords.

{greek_royal_pikemen_descr}
Hardy\nDisciplined\nInspires Friendly Units\nCan Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nOften deployed in the position of honour in a pike line (usually at the right hand end) thanks to their superior status, Macedonian royal pikemen (or hypaspists) are disciplined troops drawn from the higher echelons of society. The tough royal pikemen carry the shorter hoplite thrusting spear, and are well protected with their large round ‘argive’-pattern shields as well as leather armour. Other units can draw confidence from the presence of these proud warriors, which makes them a bulwark of many a Macedonian battle line. When close-quarter fighting starts they also carry short swords like other pikemen.

{greek_royal_pikemen_descr_short}
Well disciplined, led by high-ranking officers and carrying large shields, royal pikemen are the bulwark of the Macedonian battle line.

{greek_silver_shields}	Silver Shield Pikemen

{greek_silver_shields_descr}
Hardy\nDisciplined\nInspires Friendly Units\nCan Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nThe silver shield pikemen (or argyraspids) are the embodiment of Seleucid martial prowess. They are elite foot soldiers on which many a battle will turn; they are well disciplined and physically fit, so these troops will neither panic nor tire easily.\n\nThese men use the 6m long pike (sarissa) and carry a small shield coated in silver that gives them their name. To carry the silver shield into battle is the realization of many a Seleucid boy’s dream, though only renowned men of higher birth would automatically qualify for such an honour.\n\nOnce in phalanx formation the silver shield pikemen are an almost immovable object unless attacked from the flanks. If the fighting becomes too intense and cramped, they can use their short swords.

{greek_silver_shields_descr_short}
Silver shield pikemen are the best of the Seleucid pikemen, well disciplined and not likely to tire quickly.

The Legionary Silver Shields (or argyraspids) are equipped and fight in exactly the same fashion as Roman troops, using throwing spears (the pila, singular pilum) to pepper an enemy before closing to fight with short swords. The armour they wear and the tactics that they use are also modelled closely on the Roman originals too, including use of the tortoise (or testudo) formation to approach enemy fortifications while under fire.\n\nThe Silver Shields are very good troops indeed, and can be relied on in most battle situations.

{greek_bastarnae_descr}
Wild\nImpetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nThe Bastarnae are a particularly ferocious tribe from the northern Balkans who rejoice in man-to-man combat. Some scribes would have it that there are no fiercer men in battle, and they are a formidable resource for any Thracian commander: they are highly unlikely to break and run.\n\nEven their weapon of choice - the rhomphaia - is a cruel looking, curved blade sharpened on the inner edge, like a sickle. With one blow, this weapon is capable of severing an arm or leg. Each Bastarnae warrior also carries a small shield, which other than his helmet is his only protection, not that this lack of armour worries these fearless fighters for a moment!\n\nOften tattooed and with blue-dyed hair, the only concern with such battle-hungry fighters is that they are liable to fling themselves into the fray at the earliest opportunity.

Superior\nCan Form Wedge\n\nLight lancers are fast, lightly equipped cavalrymen who rely on hit-and-run charges where the killing power of their lances are maximised. Although they have cavalry swords for close quarters fighting, a lack of armour means once the melee becomes protracted they are susceptible to enemy counterattacks: slugging it out with heavy forces is not sensible for these soldiers. Rather, these men should operate on the periphery of battles where they can ride down enemy skirmishers and missile troops. They can be thrown into to heart of the fighting if necessary, or when a weakened unit’s flank or rear can be attacked.

Can Form Cantabrian Circle\n\nMilitia cavalry are javelin-armed mounted skirmishers who can strike quickly and be gone in the time it takes a more ponderous enemy to react. They do not wear armour, but do carry shields and swords so that they can fight in hand-to-hand combat should the need arise. They are, however, best used to dash in and harass a mass of enemies, such as heavy infantry who cannot hope to catch them. They are not ideally suited to fighting other skirmishers - many of their javelins will be wasted against targets who can dodge, after all - but they can be very useful in harrying fleeing enemies and driving them from the field.

Can Form Wedge\n\nGreek cavalry are fast moving horsemen armed with spears for maximum impact in a charge. They are not heavily armoured, and do not have shields for protection, relying instead on the old maxim of 'speed is armour' for protection. As a result, they are best used as a hit-and-run force, rather than as soldiers who can indulge in hand-to-hand combat. That said, they are excellent for breaking up skirmishers, attacking lighter infantry such as missile troops and pursuing already broken enemies to prevent them rallying and rejoining a battle.

They wear armour and carry swords but do not have shields, so they are not necessarily at their best in prolonged close combat. However, when used to repeatedly charge enemy units they can have a tremendous cumulative effect.\n\nThe Macedonians have a fine tradition of horsemanship, unlike their southerly Greek neighbours, a legacy of having a large land-owning aristocracy who could afford to keep horses, unlike the farm-owning society of Greece that produced hoplites.

They are the direct heirs to the Companions of Alexander the Great and his father, Philip of Macedon, and they revel in this proud heritage.\n\nThe Companions ride the best horses and have the finest armour available; each is armed with a good lance and a sword for close combat. As heavy cavalry they can be a decisive arm of battle, and are able to charge down many opponents. They are best used as shock cavalry to break wavering enemy formations, but do need to be careful - as with all cavalry - when attacking spearmen. Bravery is of little use when galloping straight onto a row of gleaming spear points!\n\nTraditionally these men would be given land grants after great victories, giving them a personal stake in the battle's outcome.

For this reason the driver always carries a small mallet and a spike so that he can kill the animal if necessary by driving the spike into the base of the skull.\n\nThe crew are armed with bows to shoot down into tightly packed enemy formations, but the elephant itself is also a weapon: it can trample and gore men easily, hurling them around like rag dolls.

{greek_onagers}	Onagers

{greek_onagers_descr}
Fires Incendiary Missiles\n\nThe onager is a catapult jokingly named for the tremendous kick it has when fired at the enemy (an "onager" is a wild ass). This war machine is powered by a twisted spring of animal sinew ropes, the most elastic substance available. \n\nThe throwing arm is held in tension by the sinews. When pulled back and held by a catch it can fling a boulder with considerable speed and range. This version can be used for reducing stone fortifications, but it can also be used on the battlefield for destroying enemy artillery and harassing troops (although admittedly by killing them outright). \n\nThe onager can also be used to launch incendiary missiles such as firepots, making it a versatile piece of artillery to any commander.

Elite\nImpetuous\nCan Run Amok\nFrightens Infantry\n\nScythed chariots are fearsome devices, covered in scythe blades to cut down any infantry foolish enough to stand when charged. Metal blades stick out from each axle like malign horns to cut down infantry. They are, however, somewhat uncontrollable! These units are not only so keen to attack the enemy that they will do so without orders, but also can run amok and attack anyone - friend or foe alike - who happens to be nearby. These are not subtle troops, and their chief power lies in a headlong charge into an enemy formation.\n\nEach chariot is pulled by powerful horses, and the crew is heavily armoured.

{roman_peasant}	Peasants

{roman_peasant_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nPeasants are reluctant warriors, but numbers are useful in all armies. Forcing peasants to fight is one way of getting lots of men in the field quickly and cheaply. They have little tactical sense, and even less willingness to fight - they would rather be defending their own homes than be dragged to a battle they neither care about nor understand. If nothing else, they are useful when there's digging to be done! They are, however, experts at reading the land and hiding whenever there is cover.

{roman_archer}	Roman Archers

{roman_archer_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nRoman archers are supporting troops for heavier infantry, very much a secondary role in Roman warfare. They are missile troops almost exclusively, as their lack of armour and poor hand weapons mean that only a heartless or desperate commander would deliberately order them to fight in hand-to-hand combat. Archery is not really a significant part of the Roman way of warfare, but the need for some missile troops is obvious to Roman commanders, and hence these archers are recruited from among the peasant classes.

Disciplined\nHardy\nSapping Ability\n\nArcher auxilia are supporting troops for the heavier legionary infantry, an important secondary role in Roman warfare. They are not expected to fight in hand-to-hand combat and are not given the war gear to do so for long; their job is to provide supporting fire and let the legionaries fight the main battle. Because the Roman army is standardised around its heavy infantry legionaries other types of troops are recruited as auxiliaries. Their training is very nearly as vigorous as that of the legionaries and discipline in auxilia units is certainly as harsh and uncompromising.\n\nHistorically, with the changes introduced by Gaius Marius professional auxiliaries were recruited to serve alongside the now-professional legionaries; a wholesale shake-up of the Roman military machine saw the whole army being put on a full time, service-for-life footing, with auxiliaries being rewarded with Roman citizenship at the end of their military careers.

It is their task to harass the enemy before the main combat begins.\n\nVelites are recruited from younger citizens, who lack the experience (or the money for their own gear) to fight as hastati or other heavy infantry.\n\nRoman velites become outdated after the Marius Reforms. Historically, Marius put the Roman army on a professional footing, and abandoned all property and age requirements in the process. Roman citizens would no longer go to war as-and-when as a civic duty; they would fight in future as full-time citizen-mercenaries in the Legions.

These auxilia do not wear armour and so cannot be expected to last long in hand-to-hand combat but they can fight if they must.

Sapping Ability\n\nThe town watch are local workers and peasants given enough training to defend their homes and keep order in the streets. They are no substitute for fully trained Roman legionaries, but then they are not expected to be more than a citizen militia with an interest in keeping the peace (and possibly they might have some fire fighting duties). They do not have much equipment, as the most they are expected to do is stand behind their spears and shields, and then hold position when charged. By and large, this they manage to do.

{roman_hastati}	Hastati

{roman_hastati_descr}
Hardy\nSapping Ability\n\nHastati are among the younger men in an early Republican Legion, and form the front line in any battle. They are supposed to wear down an enemy and hold him before the next Roman battle line attacks and carries on the fight. They are, as a result, capable troops in their own right.\n\nThey are armed with two pila that are thrown at the enemy at close range before they close to fight hand-to-hand. They are equipped with a sword, a bronze helmet, a large shield and a breastplate. The pilum (plural, pila) is a cleverly designed spear with a soft iron shaft behind the point; it bends on impact so that it can’t be thrown back and if it’s stuck in someone or something it is a real hindrance to movement.\n\nHistorically, hastati spent their own money on their equipment and often couldn’t afford anything much better. This, along with the age and property requirements, was why they fought as hastati.

Hastati fight as the leading edge of a Legion, wearing the enemy down for the next wave of attackers.

{roman_triarii}	Triarii

{roman_triarii_descr}
Hardy\nDisciplined\nSapping Ability\n\nTriarii are tough heavy spearmen who make up the third and most senior part of a Roman Legion before the military Reforms of Gaius Marius. They carry a long "hoplite-style" spear (the hasta) which is used to thrust, a long shield and a gladius. They are the oldest veteran soldiers, and well armoured – hardly surprising, given that they are also drawn from the richest section of society. \n\nThe triarii are the last available line in early-pattern Republican Legions. "Going to the triarii" is a Roman saying meaning carrying on to the bitter end, and if they are used it’s a sign that the moment of decision in a battle has arrived. \n\nHistorically, triarii spent their own money on their equipment and could afford to buy the best of everything.

Triarii are tough, experienced spearmen who are the senior element - the backbone - of an early Roman Legion. They can be a decisive force in battle.

{roman_infantry_auxillia}	Auxilia

{roman_infantry_auxillia_descr}
Disciplined\nHardy\nSapping Ability\n\nAuxilia are highly disciplined and tough spearmen who provide support to Roman legionaries in battle. They are defensive infantry, expected to protect the flanks of the heavier legionaries from cavalry and similar threats; their training is at least as harsh as that of the legionaries and produces men with a similar level of discipline and hardiness. These troops need to keep up with other Roman forces, and so cannot be allowed to tire easily. They are recruited from among non-Romans within the Empire, and this is easy because Roman citizenship is far from being universal.\n\nHistorically, Roman commanders made sure that auxilia were always stationed far away from home so that there was no temptation to acts of rebellion. The changes introduced by Gaius Marius meant that professional auxiliaries were recruited to serve alongside the now-professional legionaries; a wholesale shake-up of the Roman military machine saw the whole army being put on a full time, service-for-life footing, with auxiliaries being rewarded with Roman citizenship at the end of their military careers.

Disciplined\nHardy\nCan Use Testudo Formation\nSapping Capability\n\nRoman legionaries are tough, professional troops with good armour and superb weapons. Their hallmarks are discipline, obedience and tactical flexibility. When approaching enemy fortifications, for example, they can use the turtle formation, or testudo, overlapping their shields for protection. \n\nEvery legionary’s chainmail armour, the lorica hamata, is of very good quality, as is the rest of his gear: a metal helmet and a large curved shield. They fight with two throwing spears (the pilum, plural pila) and a short stabbing sword, the gladius. Each pilum has a soft iron shaft behind the piercing head that is designed to bend as soon as it hits a target, making it impossible to pull out and throw back. Embedded in a shield a pilum hampers an enemy. Embedded in a man, it usually kills. Once the pila have been thrown, legionaries close and continue fighting with the stabbing gladius. \n\nHistorically, these legionaries only came to be after the army reforms of Gaius Marius. He abandoned property and age requirements for the legions, and made the Roman army into a professional force. No longer would a man have to provide his own war gear; he would be paid, serve a term of 25 years and then retire with enough land to give him a pension for the remainder of his days.

Elite\nDisciplined\nHardy\nCan Use Testudo Formation\nSapping Capability\n\nA Praetorian cohort is made up of elite Legionaries, recruited because of their superb soldiering skills and political loyalties. A general can rely on this unit. Praetorian training is, as might be expected, both demanding and incredibly thorough. These men are some of the best, toughest, most unflinching soldiers in Rome, and they know it!\n\nTheir equipment is much the same as other legionaries, but better made. Every praetorian wears banded armour, the lorica segmenta, a metal helmet and carries a large curved shield. They fight with two heavy throwing spears (the pilum, plural pila) and a short stabbing sword, the gladius. Each pilum has a soft iron shaft behind the piercing head that is designed to bend as soon as it hits a target, making it impossible to pull out and throw back. Once the pila have been thrown, praetorians close and continue fighting with the stabbing gladius. They can also use the testudo, or tortoise, to protect themselves from missiles.\n\nHistorically, the original praetorians were the 'bravest of the brave' chosen to guard the praetorium - the tent of the legate of the legion when in the field. These men came to act as bodyguards for all important generals, before being made into specific formations that were considered useful in politics as well as war. It was Augustus who established the Praetorian Guard as both a bodyguard and for useful intimidation in Rome. It was under the later Emperors that the Praetorians developed a taste for conspiracy and murder.

These are heavy infantry who, when not performing garrison duties in the vital cities of the empire, fight as heavy infantry - the men who do the real work in a Roman army!\n\nTraining for any man in an urban cohort is demanding and produces incredibly tough men. The results are the best, toughest, most unflinching soldiers in the Roman world, men who will stop at little to achieve their goals. The urban cohorts are equipped with the same gear as legionaries - it is the men inside the uniform that make them effective - and wear banded armour, the lorica segmenta, metal helmets and carry large shields. They fight with two pila (singular, pilum), throwing spears with soft iron shafts that are designed to bend as soon as they hit making them impossible to fling back. They also carry short stabbing swords for close work.\n\nHistorically, the urban cohorts were a police force for Rome established by Augustus, and were commanded to keep order. Although outnumbered, they were a counterbalance of sorts to the power of the Praetorian Guards within the city. Life in the urban cohorts was better than in the 'line' legions, as pay and service conditions were better. Other urban cohorts were established in the larger cities of the Empire in later years, and the prefect in charge of the cohorts often became an important political figure.

They fight wearing little armour - their lot in life isn't necessarily to live, but to die in an entertaining manner. Samnites would normally fight as one half of a matched pair, but on a battlefield they form a unit all of their own.\n\nThey are a specialised elite, one that cares little for personal safety as the only way to attain any reward is through victory!

Can Form Wedge\n\nEquites are light cavalrymen armed with spears. In the Roman system of war, they are intended to drive off skirmishers and pursue fleeing enemies. The word equites means 'horsemen', and they are recruited from among the well-off sections of society. They wear little armour and only carry spears and shields. As a result, they can charge enemies, but may be cut to pieces by a prepared defensive line of spearmen if these were attacked head on. Instead, they should be used against the flanks or rear of units, or to keep missile troops and skirmishers away from the main Roman heavy infantry (who are the real killers of a Roman army).\n\nHistorically, equites were drawn from the equestrian classes - literally the rich people who could afford to own horses - and they spent their own money on both horse and war gear.

They do not wear armour, but do carry shields and swords so that they can fight in their own defence should the need arise. They are, however, best used to harass a mass of enemy units such as heavy infantry. Such targets cannot hope to catch them! They are not ideally suited to fighting other skirmishers, as many of their javelins will be wasted against targets that can dodge, but they can be very useful in harrying fleeing enemies and driving them from the field.

Superior\nDisciplined\nHardy\nCan Form Wedge\n\nLegionary cavalry are a heavy force of spear-armed cavalry who charge home using shock and mass to achieve victory. They are tough, disciplined riders - a notable advantage compared to many cavalry units who are composed of headstrong and impetuous 'nobility'. They are probably wasted when used to ride down skirmishers and missile troops, but they have the power to be able to smash heavier infantry formations apart, and severely disrupt other cavalry. They must, however, take care when attacking prepared spearmen, and should certainly avoid a frontal charge in this case whenever possible.\n\nThey wear good armour and carry shields; their weapons are the spear (lancea) and long sword (spatha), both of which are deadly in the hands of an expert.\n\nHistorically, Rome's best cavalry forces were organised into wings (or alae, singular ala) rather than cohorts, and recruited from among horse-culture minorities within Rome's borders. Generally, this meant that cavalry were predominantly non-Italian, the opposite of the legionaries' composition. Romans had developed the art of fighting as infantry, and relied on others to provide what they considered to be the supporting arms such as cavalry.

This war machine is powered by a twisted spring of animal sinew ropes, the most elastic substance available. \n\nThe throwing arm is held in tension by the sinews. When pulled back and held by a catch it can fling a boulder with considerable speed and range. This version can be used for reducing stone fortifications, but it can also be used on the battlefield for destroying enemy artillery and harassing troops (although admittedly by killing some of them outright).\n\nThe onager can also be used to launch incendiary missiles such as firepots, making it a versatile piece of artillery to any commander.

{roman_repeating_ballistae_descr}
Hardy (crew)\n\nThe repeating ballista is a semi-automatic artillery weapon. As long as it is loaded with bolts and cranked it will keep firing. The basic design is similar to a ballista: twisted animal sinew ropes provide the power. There is an ingenious winding mechanism that draws back the arms, drops a bolt into place and then releases a catch - and all this happens repeatedly as long as a windlass is turned.\n\nThis makes it a perfect weapon for creating a 'beaten zone' or targeting large enemy formations, when speed of fire is more important than pinpoint accuracy.

These spear-armed cavalry are an elite reserve for use in a moment of crisis.\n\nEvery warlord commands by right of personal courage as much as tactical skill, and this is doubly true of a rebel who has gone against the established order of his tribe and people. He and his guards are equipped as cavalry with spears, leather armour and shields so that they can dash to any point on the battlefield. The warlord can inspire his men to greater efforts just by his presence, and also has enough men in his guard to be a significant force.

Long downtrodden by a succession of conquerors, the people of Judea have substituted courage for war gear when in battle. Although poorly armed as spearmen, these men will sacrifice themselves.\n\nTheir ranks are swelled by deserters from many armies as well as by the professional warriors of the temple guard, but they are often chaotically organised into many separate groups, sects, fronts, movements, factions and so on. Their loyalty may be to Judea, but each group is its own 'one true' resistance movement, or peoples' front, or popular front.

Expert at Hiding in Forests\nCan Hide in Long Grass\nSapping Ability\n\nMercenary peltasts are lightly equipped, fast-moving skirmishers who wear down enemies with a hail of accurately thrown javelins. \n\nTheir strength lies in their ability to move through broken or rough terrain, and to stay away from enemies. They also carry straight swords and small shields (the pelte that gives them their title). \n\nAs a result, they can fight quite effectively against other units of skirmishers but are vulnerable if caught in the open by cavalry. They are, however, perfect for use in tactical ambushes, attacking careless enemies who have not spotted them.

They come from the tribes in the western Balkans. These troops are unruly skirmishers equipped with javelins and large shields, as well as short swords for close combat.\n\nThe Illyrian tribes are experienced land and sea raiders, and their chief joy is the prospect of plunder! One of the more famed Illyrian kings, Bardylis, built his success and reputation on the basis of his equitable distribution of the spoils after each successful battle. This expectation of loot contributes to their occasional over-enthusiasm to get into a fight.\n\nThese troops are effective ambushers, and they have good prospects of defeating most other skirmishers in combat.

{merc_thracian}	Thracian Mercenaries

{merc_thracian_descr}
Impetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nThracian mercenaries are fearsome barbarian warriors, experts with the rhomphaia, a deadly bladed weapon that can cleave enemy infantry. These troops fight in loose formations, as they need space to wield their weapons to full advantage. They are best employed to cut into tightly packed enemy units, but can also give a good account of themselves against light cavalry.\n \nThe rhomphaia itself is a frightening weapon, used either one or two-handed. It comprises a curved, poleaxe weapon, and as the blade is sharpened along the inner edge, the damage on the blow is done with a pulling motion. When used properly, a rhomphaia can easily hack off limbs or decapitate an enemy.\n\nThracians are renowned for their love of battle, and victorious warriors often return to camp singing songs and displaying severed heads impaled on their rhomphaias. This love of a good fight also encourages them to attack from time to time without orders. A Greek writer once said that they could conquer the world - if they ever stop fighting each other for long enough!

Superior\nImpetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nThe Bastarnae are a particularly ferocious tribe from the northern Balkans who rejoice in man-to-man combat. Some scribes would have it that there are no fiercer men in battle, and they are a formidable resource for any commander: they are highly unlikely to break and run.\n\nEven their weapon of choice - the rhomphaia - is a cruel looking, curved blade sharpened on the inner edge, like a sickle. With one blow, this weapon is capable of severing an arm or leg. Each Bastarnae warrior also carries a small shield, which other than his helmet is his only protection, not that this lack of armour worries these fearless fighters for a moment!\n\nOften tattooed and with blue-dyed hair, the only concern with such battle-hungry fighters is that they are liable to fling themselves into the fray at the earliest opportunity.

They are superb warriors, heavily armoured and well equipped, and an almost unstoppable force when at full charge.\n\nThey wear chainmail tunics that hang down to their knees, reinforced with scales of animal horn. Each Sarmatian cavalryman carries a two-handed lance (called a kontos), and this is used during a full charge into melee. If the enemy doesn’t break each man also carries a sword, but no shield. As with many ‘elites’, they are not averse to charging worthy enemies without orders. \n\nThe Sarmatians are almost notorious for their widespread banditry, and many serve as mercenaries. Historically, thousands were sent to Britannia under the Emperors where many settled after garrison duty.

Their good horsemanship means catching them with a counter-charge is difficult, even with light cavalry, and they possess enormous stamina, hardened by crossing vast distances on the plains of their homelands.\n\nThe Scythians are not the most refined of races, covering their quivers with human skin, and not washing themselves for months. In camp, they are usually best well away from more 'civilised' units!

{merc_spanish_infantry}	Spanish Mercenaries

{merc_spanish_infantry_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nThese Spanish mercenaries are well-equipped light infantry, sometimes referred to as scutarii by the Romans because of their large oval shields (the Latin for shield being ‘scutum’). Armed with heavy javelins as well as swords, they fight by bombarding the enemy and then closing to fight hand to hand, in a similar way to Roman legionaries.\n\nCenturies of feuding among the Spanish hill tribes have hardened the people so there is no shortage of tough, brave warriors.\n\nHistorically, the design of the later Roman legionary sword (or gladius) was influenced by the blades carried by these men. The design was adopted after Roman armies had faced large formations of scutarii during the First Punic War.

{merc_eastern_infantry}	Eastern Mercenaries

{merc_eastern_infantry_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nThese mercenaries are spearmen, though their lack of armour and training means they can't match most professional infantry. They carry a 2m long spear and a large shield.\n\nMany of these mercenaries would once have been peasants or urban poor recruited into the standing army of an Eastern kingdom; with no homes to return to, they have taken to a life of soldiering.\n\nWhile they may be numerous, they are often not well paid by their captains, and their motivation can be a little bit suspect. Individually they are not skilled fighters, but as a group they can be used to hold a line against lighter cavalry and lower-quality infantry.

Trained from infancy, these missile troops also include men drawn from the hilly areas of mainland Greece.\n\nThey carry only a small shield for protection, and are best kept out of hand-to-hand combat.

If left unprotected they are vulnerable to attacks by cavalry and light skirmishers, as they have little chance of lasting for long in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nHistorically, the term ‘Cretan’ came to represent a fighting style rather than an area of origin, so many of these mercenaries are from elsewhere in the Greek world. Those originally from Crete are highly valued in cities and towns on the mainland as archery instructors.

{merc_greek_hoplites}	Mercenary Hoplites

{merc_greek_hoplites_descr}
Hardy\nCan Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nHoplites are spearmen that are most effective in the formidable, if slightly inflexible, phalanx formation: a tight block of men presenting many spear points to the enemy. Operating in such a fashion, these units are a powerful force against infantry or cavalry. Hoplite tactics are simple: a unit generally approaches in normal order, and then closes up into a phalanx so that each soldier is protected by the overlapping shield of his neighbour. It is simply a matter of closing with the enemy as quickly as possible to decide the battle. \n\nThe basis of military power in ancient Greece was the hoplite and his willingness to fight alongside his fellow citizens, but now these troops are some of the most effective mercenaries in the known world. Hoplites wear a hardened leather cuirass breastplate, and carry both a round shield (the hoplon) and a thrusting spear. This spear has a bronze butt-spike to plant in the ground (bronze, unlike iron, does not rust), which doubles as a weapon if the spear shaft breaks.

These mercenaries are used to break up enemy units with a shower of javelins - a traditional weapon in Libya - as the battle lines close on each other. They cannot be expected to fight well in a melee. They are generally similar to the peltasts of other nations: light infantry who carry javelins, swords and small shields (usually fashioned from hardened ostrich hide). Other than a leather cap they wear no armour. \n\nThey are mobile enough to stay out of trouble but are, as is so often the case with skirmishers, vulnerable when caught on open ground. They are best used in broken and wooded terrain, where they can hide and ambush enemy formations before the main battle is joined.

Numidia produces the finest cavalry in all Africa, if not the Western Mediterranean world. Armed with javelins, these mercenaries can be a nightmare for an opponent as it can prove practically impossible to pin them down in combat!\n\nTheir tactics are to pelt the enemy with deadly volleys of javelins, and then swiftly retreat. If the enemy stand, they are slaughtered with volleys of javelins. If they run, the Numidian cavalry can ride them down!\n\nInstinctive riders, the Numidians are famed for not using a saddle or reins, using only a stick to direct their horses. Nevertheless, they manoeuvre with 'the grace of a flock of birds'. Having adapted to the broken expanses of their homelands, Numidian cavalry also have great stamina.

They make excellent scouts, and can sweep down on a broken foe or an exposed unit of skirmishers, but their lack of formal military training means they are at a disadvantage in a serious fight.\n\nArmed with scimitar-style swords and equipped with shields made from woven reeds, they wear no armour due to the heat of the desert sun. Instead, they cover themselves with traditional robes, which are also protection against roaring sandstorms.

They are used to break enemy lines and simply intimidate enemies into running away.\n\nEach elephant carries a tower with two archers, but they can also gore and trample opponents. The catch with elephants is that they can panic when injured and run amok. In this case, anyone who gets in the way is in danger, regardless of whether or not they are friend or foe. Elephant drivers have been known to carry chisels and mallets so that they can kill panicked animals with a blow to the base of the skull before the beasts can cause too much chaos.

Elite\nImpetuous\nFrightens Infantry\n\nHeavy chariots are an elite in British armies ridden into battle by tribal nobles. They are shock troops, relying on speed and shock to break enemy formations.\n\nEvery man carries a fine sword, and is equipped with a good mail coat and a shield, while his chariot is pulled by two horses.\n\nThey perform the same function as heavy cavalry, charging home to cause casualties before wheeling away to launch a fresh attack. Any infantry foolish enough to stand in the way are ridden down, hacked to pieces by the rider! However, like many barbarians they can sometimes let greed for personal honour and glory lead them into attacking without orders.

{roman_principes}	Principes

{roman_principes_descr}
Disciplined\nHardy\nSapping Ability\n\nPrincipes are older, more reliable soldiers who have seen some service. It is their task to be the second line of a legion and carry on the fight once the hastati are spent. They are supposed to carry on the 'wearing down' fight and exhaust the enemy. They are, as a result, capable soldiers and unafraid of combat.\n\nThey are armed with two pila that are thrown at the enemy at close range before they close to fight hand-to-hand. They are each equipped with a sword, a bronze helmet, a large shield and chain armour. The pilum (plural, pila) is a cleverly designed spear with a soft iron shaft behind the point; it bends on impact so that it can’t be thrown back and if it’s stuck in someone or something it is a real hindrance to movement - always assuming whoever it's stuck in isn't dead!\n\nHistorically, principes spent their own money on their equipment and, being older, were in a position to buy better gear than the young hastati. This, along with the age and property requirements, was why they fought as principes.

{egyptian_peltast_descr}
Expert at Hiding in Forests\nCan Hide in Long Grass\nSapping Ability\n\nEgyptian skirmishers rush forward to pepper an enemy with javelins, and then withdraw in good order before a counter-attack can be organised. It is their task to harass and disrupt enemy units as well as screen the main force of the army. They are also adept at staging tactical ambushes.\n\nSkirmishers are equipped with a clutch of javelins, a sword and a light shield. They wear no other armour, and rely on speed as the best form of protection. This doesn't work when facing cavalry!\n\nOddly, many Egyptian skirmishers aren't Egyptians at all, but are recruited from among foreign communities. When they can be found, Egyptian generals favour using Thracians for this role as they are particularly bloodthirsty and known to take the heads of fallen enemies as trophies.

Superior\nImpetuous\nSapping Ability\n\nThese Cilician mercenaries are excellent and well-armed skirmishers, if somewhat hot-headed! They try to weaken less mobile enemy formations by showering them with harpoons before closing to finish the job with their hand axes.\n\nThe eastern Mediterranean is often a stamping ground for buccaneers and pirates, most notorious among them the Cilicians from the south-eastern coast of Asia Minor. Used to a lawless, brutal life as marines aboard ship, these troops are a merciless force, prepared to give and receive no quarter and not always keen to obey orders.\n\nAlthough there is a lucrative career to be had capturing ships' crews to sell as slaves, many Cilicians seek employment in foreign armies. Their lust for loot and others’ lives makes them inclined to attack first and think later.

{carthaginian_infantry}	Iberian Infantry

{carthaginian_infantry_descr}
Sapping Ability\n\nIberian infantry are fast moving close combat infantry. They may not be the best trained troops, but they are cost effective warriors. They are one of the basic units available to generals in the Carthaginian-influenced world. Every Iberian infantryman carries a shield in addition to his short sword, but his only other protection is a helmet; he relies on speed and agility instead of armour. They are best employed against enemy spearmen and, like other infantry, can be vulnerable to cavalry attacks.

{carthaginian_infantry_descr_short}
These infantry are the steady backbone of the armies of Carthage and Spain. Reliable, well-armed and tough, they are armed with falcatas to cut a path into an enemy line.

{scutarii}	Scutarii

{scutarii_descr}
Impetuous\nExpert at Hiding in Forests\n\nScutarii are well-equipped light infantry armed with swords, shields and heavy javelins.They are called by the Romans because of their distinctive, large, oval shields (the Latin for shield being ‘scutum’). They fight with heavy javelins and swords, peppering the enemy with missiles before closing up for hand-to-hand combat. Centuries of feuding among the hill tribes have hardened the people so there is no shortage of tough and cunning warriors - they are quite handy when springing tactical ambushes on enemy units.\n\nHistorically, the design of the later Roman legionary sword (or gladius) was influenced by the blades carried by these men. The design was adopted after Roman armies had faced large formations of scutarii during the First Punic War.

Can Form Phalanx\nSapping Ability\n\nMilitia hoplites are levies drawn from cities and thrust into battle with a little training. They fight best as spearmen, and are armed with long spears and each carries the large round hoplon shield which gives them their name. As a type of infantry hoplites have been around for centuries and have changed little in tactics or equipment. These men wear no armour, but then they are drawn from the poorer classes and it is traditional for citizens to provide their own war gear when called into the army. The cities of the Greek world have a long tradition of the people defending their own cities from invaders.\n\nThey are at their best when used as a solid block of spearmen and can form a phalanx to attack the enemy.

They are best employed against light cavalry and horse archers, if only because of the effects that camels have on horses unused to their distinct aroma. Their speed also makes them useful against skirmishers and foot missile troops.\n\nThey carry swords and shields, but do not bother with armour - hardly surprising given that the desert conditions of their homelands make wearing armour foolish indeed - unless the prospect of broiling to death is appealing!

They wear light padded armour - hardly surprising given the incredibly hot climate of home - and carry large shields. They do not carry secondary weapons at all, and rely entirely on their spears in combat. This means that they are best employed to hold a defensive position against cavalry, or as a rough phalanx to take on other infantry by 'push of pike' and weight of numbers.\n\nThese men are better trained than some other Egyptian forces, such as Nubian spearmen, and will hold more often as a result.

The armoured crews carry swords to cut down opponents. Egyptian armies have a long and distinguished history of using chariots in warfare. Their charioteers are also more disciplined and controlled than those of other nations.

This has been added for a code fix. Do not re-translate. Please speak to Luci\n\nA trireme is a powerful warship, propelled by three banks of oars and a sail. It can ram opposing ships and launch boarding actions.\n\nOriginally a Greek design, it has been widely copied because of its good qualities. Skilled oarsmen are needed, but then this gives the ship tremendous power in a 'sprint' at ramming speed. As might be expected, the trireme is its own main weapon, as it carries an iron-tipped ram on the bow at the waterline. Once an enemy ship has been rammed or had its oars smashed, the crew back water to withdraw before seeking another target.

Its sheer size makes it hard to sink.\n\nThe bulk of the crew are rowers as there are five men to each oar; this pulling power is good, but maintaining ramming or battle speed is very tiring.\n\nThe corvus was developed by Rome during the first Punic War as a means of turning sea battles into land battles, and allowing its superior infantry to become decisive. It is an iron 'beak' on a hinged walkway that is designed to smash down into enemy decking doing two jobs in one: making a bridge for the marines to cross, and locking the two ships together so that the battle has to be fought on the quinquireme captain's terms.

This has been added for a code fix. Do not re-translate. Please speak to Luci\n\nThe mighty deceres is a dreadnought in the ancient Mediterranean. In size, number of men and fighting potential it dwarfs all other vessels. A deceres is among the largest ships afloat, and is crewed by anything up to 850 men - most, of course, being rowers.\n\nIts combat power is formidable. Apart from a couple of fighting towers, a deceres also carries onagers and ballistae to bombard enemies, plus a large contingent of marines for boarding and defence. At least one ballista will also be set up to fire a harpoon-like grappling hook (called a harpago) at enemy vessels so that they can be dragged alongside and destroyed.\n\nAs a tactic the harpago has much to recommend it over, say, the grappling 'corvus' of smaller ships, because it allows enemies to be snagged at greater range.

A bireme combines power and good handling in a vessel that does not need to large a crew. \n\nPirates sail from every remote cove, every lawless harbour and every independent city (and a few cities that are supposedly law-abiding) along the Mediterranean coast. They are like flies - always present when there are rich pickings, and only temporarily driven off by the wave of an imperial hand. Kill one fly, and more come in its place.\n\nAs well as menacing trade, pirates can sometimes gather in sufficient strength to threaten even the great naval powers.

Can Form Wedge\n\nRoman cavalry are auxiliary spear-armed cavalry who have a screening role in a Roman army. They should be used against the flanks or rear of units, or to keep missile troops and skirmishers away from the main Roman heavy infantry (who are the real killers of a Roman army).\n\nThey wear little armour and only carry spears and shields. As a result, they can charge enemies, but may be cut to pieces by a prepared defensive line of spearmen if these were attacked head on.\n\nHistorically, Roman cavalry only came into existence after the army reforms of Gaius Marius as a replacement force for the equites. The property qualifications for fighting as cavalry in the army were abandoned and the army made professional. They were organised into 'wings' called alae rather than cohorts.

Chosen axemen are an elite among tribal warriors, selected for their physical size, strength, bravery and - some would say - pig-headedness. They are the assault troops of any barbarian army, the men whose only job is to smash any organised resistance and keep on killing until no foes remain. Fear is completely alien to them, as is any concept of mercy to a foe or a weakling among their own kind. They are fantastically strong men - and need to be to wield their enormous two-handed axes with any degree of skill and control.\n\nThe axes are easily capable of cleaving a man down to his breastbone even through armour.

{amazon_chariots_descr}
Elite\nFrightens Infantry\nCan Form Cantabrian Circle\n\nLegendary warriors from the land beyond the north wind, these cruel and beautiful women are dangerous indeed to all who oppose them in battle. Many warriors misjudge their alluring appearance, a mistake that few ever live long enough to regret! The thundering sound of their chariots is often enough to un-man even the strongest enemies.\n\nRiding chariots into battle, the Amazon way of warfare relies on using their composite bows to pepper enemies at a distance, before closing to hack enemies to pieces. In either case, they are well protected by the speed of their chariots and by the high quality armour that they wear.
